## Installation and Setup

To install and use the DecideIt app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
If you haven't already cloned the project, you can do so by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/decideit.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
If you're planning to develop further or run it locally using a local server, open the project folder in VS Code and install any dependencies you may need.
3. **Open the Project:** Open the project folder in VS Code.
4. **Start the Local Development Server** For best results, use Live Server in VS Code to run the app. Right-click on the `index.html` file in the VS Code Explorer. Select **Open with Live Server**. This will start a local server and open the app in your default browser.
5. **View on Mobile:** In your browser, right-click anywhere on the page and choose Inspect (or press `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
Switch to Mobile View by clicking the device toolbar icon (or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+M`). Then choose a mobile device from the dropdown to test responsiveness.


## Development

### Running Locally with VS Code and Live Server:

1. **Install VS Code (if not installed):** [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install Live Server Extension:** Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`). Search for **Live Server** and install it.

3. **Run the Project:** Open the project folder in VS Code. Right-click on `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.
